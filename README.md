## Customer example

* Once a user is logged in as a customer in the todo section, there is a complete list of tasks that customer has created and are pending to be completed by the assigned moderator.
* Customer can also create new Tasks by sending a POST request to the URL http://drfdjango.pythonanywhere.com/todo/ once the user is logged in.
* Customer can also change or delete the task by sending a PUT or DELETE request at http://drfdjango.pythonanywhere.com/todo/'id_of_the_post'
* Customer can also view the completed tasks through : http://drfdjango.pythonanywhere.com/completed/  along with the comments from moderators/
* POST request Example JSON
```
{
        "id": 18,
        "title": "Task3",
